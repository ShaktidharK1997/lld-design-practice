    "## Initial Prompt : Design a Parking Lot System \n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions to be asked \n",
    "1. System Scope\n",
    "    1. (Is this for a single Parking Lot or a generic system usable by multiple parking lots ?) Single Parking Lot : Singleton class, Multiple : Normal Class \n",
    "    2. Will this parking lot have multiple levels (floors) in it? Yes : Maintain a list in Parking lot called levels which has level objects in it \n",
    "2. Understand Classes and Enums\n",
    "    1. Will there be multiple types of vehichles being parked here? (Enum Vehicle Type) and (Base Vehicle Abstract Class)\n",
    "    2. Are we going to store the Receipts and reservation details ? (Receipt Class and Reservation Class)\n",
    "    3. Are we going to have Parking Spots which are parkable by a specific vehicle type? (Yes, we are going to have)\n",
    "3. Clarify the core features\n",
    "    1. We are going to have check-in, checkout, real-time info and receipt generation as the features exposed to end user ?\n",
    "    2. Are we going to calculate the fees based on the time spent? Is there a formula I need to use here?\n",
    "    3. check-in : allocates parking spot to vehicle\n",
    "    4. check-out : deallocates parking spot given to vehicle\n",
    "    5. real-time info : displays vacant spots in the parking lot level wise\n",
    "    6. receipt generation : Generates and stores receipt based on parking usage on check-out\n",
    "\n",
